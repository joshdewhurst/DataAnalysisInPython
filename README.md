## Project: Analyzing Sales Data for an E-commerce Store

### Problem Statement:

A fictional e-commerce store has provided us with their sales data for the past year. The data includes information on sales revenue, products sold, customer demographics, and shipping information. Our task is to analyze the data and provide insights on the following questions:

1. What is the overall revenue for the year?
2. What were the top-selling products?
3. What was the average order value?
4. What is the customer demographics like?
5. What was the shipping cost distribution?
6. Can we identify any trends or patterns in the sales data?

### Libraries Used:

For this project, we will be using the following libraries:

- Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy: for numerical computing
- Matplotlib: for data visualization

### Functions:

#### Loading the Data:

We will start by loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame using the `read_csv()` function:

`
import pandas as pd
`

# Load the data from a CSV file
`
sales_data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")
`


# Overall Revenue:
To calculate the overall revenue for the year, we can use the sum() function to sum up the revenue column:
'# Calculate the overall revenue
overall_revenue = sales_data["revenue"].sum()
'

# Top-Selling Products:
To identify the top-selling products, we can use the groupby() function to group the data by product, and then use the sum() function to calculate the total revenue for each product:
